                            Hi! We are Gerakan Developer Tanahair, a group of students + alumni who are passionate about software development.
                            We started as a study group called Lambda, but we have since expanded to include more students. The current iteration
                            is called Gerakan Developer Tanahair. We are currently based in IIUM, but we have plans to expand to other universities.
                            Most of the orignal members of Lambda are now working in the industry, but we still meet regularly to discuss topics on software
                            engineering.
                        </p>

                            Our members comes from different Kulliyyahs with different backgrounds, with a majority from KOE and KICT.

                            Our vision is to grow a developer culture in IIUM. We want to create a community where students can learn and grow together.
                            In IIUM, we have a thriving political and religious culture, but we lack a developer culture. We want to change that.
                            Our passion is not only to create software, but to create a better <strong>Ummah</strong>.
                        </p>

                            Imagine a university where every student has the opportunity to unlock their full potential by diving into the world of hacking and development. The impact extends beyond the classroom, creating a community of lifelong learners and innovators ready to tackle the challenges of the digital age.
